SPS Website
===========

The 2020 is just to distinguish it from other earlier versions of the SPS website.

Developer Overview
==================

As with most Django projects, the main entry point is urls.py. You should look at that first.
Each url is tied to a single function, which are grouped by category throughout the other files.

static contains image, CSS, JavaScript, and all non-html files that are served by the website.

static_html contains (mostly) static webpages. These are automatically wrapper in the header/footer by static_page_loader.py before they are served.

templates contains the HTML templates that Django can access. The first argument to the Django template functions render_to_string or render should be a filename for an HTML file in templates.

Installation
============

For basic testing, you will want to use the test repository, which is configured to automatically generate fake secrets files and start a Django test webserver.

For actual installation, this repository should be installed to the home directory (for compatibility with https://github.com/ucbsps/sps_web_sync). Setting up a virtual environment is recommended.

Python packages django, flup6, and mariadb should be installed.

In addition, a MariaDB server is required. sps_web_2020 assumes that the default port (3306) is used.
