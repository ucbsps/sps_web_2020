						Hey there! I'm <b>Shantanu Kadam</b> (<i>srkadam “at” berkeley.edu</i>) a physics major who cares about the environment. When I'm not at the chalkboard, you can find me swing dancing, cooking, daydreaming about Siberian Huskies, exploring Berkeley for vegan treats, perpetually drinking tea, reading, and (most importantly!) sleeping. Home sweet home is back in Alabama, so if you have any concerns about being far from home, please share them with me!

						<b>Fanghui “Wendy” Wan</b> (<i>wendywan_2022 “at” berkeley.edu</i>) is a fourth-year majoring in physics and applied math. Barely started doing research in James Analytis lab, she is already overwhelmed by the hard problem(sets) in physics classes. Wendy is nearsighted but reluctant to wear glasses, so make sure to say hi before she sees you in the hall way.

						Hi there! I'm <b>Christian Ramos</b> (<i>christramo069 “at” berkeley.edu</i>), a third year majoring in physics and astrophysics. I'm from Chowchilla, CA which is a small town in the middle of absolutely nowhere. I'm a 2x GBO leader and one of the Undergraduate Climate Advisors for the Astronomy Department so feel free to talk to me about anything (doesn't have to be about physics specifically). I'm currently not involved in research though I am very interested in cosmology and compact object mergers. I enjoy playing volleyball, eating a lot of fast food, and listening to music. So if you'd like to do any of those things together and/or would like to chat, feel free to reach out!

						Hi! I'm <b>Digvijay Roy Varier</b> (<i> digvijayroyvarier “at” berkeley.edu</i>) a fourth-year Physics and Math major who started off with a passion for Number Theory and Organic Chemistry, but got dangerously attracted to String Theory in senior year of high school. I am interested in particle/high-energy theory and have done research in super-symmetric gauge theories, neutrino-nucleon interactions, charged-lepton flavor violation and di-photon Higgs decay. Since I barely sleep, I have a lot of time for hobbies, which include acrylic painting, playing the violin, taking random photographs, watching cricket matches, hitting cricket shots in a game of tennis, and trying out beat-boxing. The probability of finding me in a dull mood is exactly zero, so feel free to strike up a conversation!
