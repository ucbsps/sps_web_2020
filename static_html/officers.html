						<b>Fanghui “Wendy” Wan</b> (<i>wendywan_2022 “at” berkeley.edu</i>) is a third-year physics major. Barely started doing research in James Analytis lab, she is already overwhelmed by the hard problem(sets) in physics classes. Wendy is nearsighted but reluctant to wear glasses, so make sure to say hi before she sees you in the hall way.

					<p class="content">
						<b>Nicolas Kalem</b> (<i>nicolaskalem3801 “at” berkeley.edu</i>) is a second-year physics student. He thinks physics is very very hard, yet somehow found himself investigating and modeling antihydrogen behavior for ALPHA at CERN. Outside of physics, I enjoy bowling, playing tennis, swimming (especially swimming), sitting at the steps of Sather Tower while eating a quesadilla and staring out at the Golden Gate Bridge, and spending quality time with quality people. You probably won’t see me in the main areas of LeConte so if you find me you get a prize. Also if any of you want a swimming buddy, I’m your guy.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						There is an idea of a Nicolas Kalem. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.

						<b>Charlie Cummings</b> (<i>charlie.cummings “at” berkeley.edu</i>) is a fourth year physics and math major who, despite consistently being told by others he is from San Diego, is actually from Tennessee. He is currently working in a lab attempting to constrain supersymmetric extensions of the standard model, which means he is now an expert at banging vacuum tubes with a wrench, crying when the apparatus doesn't work. If you're still reading this, congrats on your dedication, and feel free to email him with any more questions, SPS, his experience in the department/Cal, why Vsauce is the best, or anything else at all.

						<b>Xuyang Yu</b> (<i>xuyangy1505 “at” berkeley.edu</i>) is a third-year physics and math major. Once a topology-lover, he now wishes to do string theory. When not wandering around, his position collapses to dorm or LeConte or both. He used to jog/play badminton for some time but his high-energy study forced that time to be short. He once enjoyed chess but now who knows. His dream is to build a time machine.
