						Hey there! I'm <b>Shantanu Kadam</b> <i>(srkadam “at” berkeley.edu)</i> a physics major who cares about the environment. When I'm not at the chalkboard, you can find me swing dancing, cooking, daydreaming about Siberian Huskies, exploring Berkeley for vegan treats, perpetually drinking tea, reading, and (most importantly!) sleeping. Home sweet home is back in Alabama, so if you have any concerns about being far from home, please share them with me!

						<b>Fanghui “Wendy” Wan</b> (<i>wendywan_2022 “at” berkeley.edu</i>) is a fourth-year physics major. Barely started doing research in James Analytis lab, she is already overwhelmed by the hard problem(sets) in physics classes. Wendy is nearsighted but reluctant to wear glasses, so make sure to say hi before she sees you in the hall way.

					<p class="content">
						<b>Nicolas Kalem</b> (<i>nicolaskalem3801  berkeley.edu</i>) is a second-year physics student. He thinks physics is very very hard, yet somehow found himself investigating and modeling antihydrogen behavior for ALPHA at CERN. Outside of physics, I enjoy bowling, playing tennis, swimming (especially swimming), sitting at the steps of Sather Tower while eating a quesadilla and staring out at the Golden Gate Bridge, and spending quality time with quality people. You probably won’t see me in the main areas of LeConte so if you find me you get a prize. Also if any of you want a swimming buddy, I’m your guy.
					</p>
					<p class="content">
						There is an idea of a Nicolas Kalem. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.

						Hi there! I'm <b>Christian Ramos</b> (<i>christramo069 “at” berkeley.edu</i>), a third year majoring in physics and astrophysics. I'm from Chowchilla, CA which is a small town in the middle of absolutely nowhere. I'm a 2x GBO leader and one of the Undergraduate Climate Advisors for the Astronomy Department so feel free to talk to me about anything (doesn't have to be about physics specifically). I'm currently not involved in research though I am very interested in cosmology and compact object mergers. I enjoy playing volleyball, eating a lot of fast food, and listening to music. So if you'd like to do any of those things together and/or would like to chat, feel free to reach out!

When not wandering around, his position collapses to dorm or LeConte or both. He used to jog/play badminton for some time but his high-energy study forced that time to be short. He once enjoyed chess but now who knows. His dream is to build a time machine.

						Hi! I'm <b>Digvijay Roy Varier</b> (<i> digvijayroyvarier “at” berkeley.edu</i>) a fourth-year Physics and Math major who started off with a passion for Number Theory and Organic Chemistry, but got dangerously attracted to String Theory in senior year of high school. I am interested in particle/high-energy theory and have done research in super-symmetric gauge theories, neutrino-nucleon interactions, charged-lepton flavor violation and di-photon Higgs decay. Since I barely sleep, I have a lot of time for hobbies, which include acrylic painting, playing the violin, taking random photographs, watching cricket matches, hitting cricket shots in a game of tennis, and trying out beat-boxing. The probability of finding me in a dull mood is exactly zero, so feel free to strike up a conversation!

He currently investigates proton light yield in organic scintillators with the Orebi-Gann group and is on the signals &amp; controls team for Berkeley Hyperloop. In the rare moments not in LeConte or setting π equal to 3, he can be found playing board games, messing with circuits, and managing the physics meme page. Notice: When studying in the reading room at the 4 in the morning, Siddhant is easily startled. Please do not tap on the glass.
