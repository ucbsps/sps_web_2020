					Hiya! I'm <b>Elena Grace Vasquez</b> (<i>elenavasquez “at” berkeley.edu</i>), a fourth year majoring in Physics and (kinda) Applied Math. I am working on spatiotemporally resolved energy flow research with the Ginsberg Group (in Chemistry, oops), and am planning to pursue Medical Physics (which is not quite biophysics, come talk to me about it!). When I am not in the reading room doing problem sets, I can be found dancing, enjoying nature, or traveling (with what time? I can't tell you).
