			Tired of your endless physics problem sets? No better way to take a break from them than doing more (and “funner”) physics with us! 
			Run by the wonderful officers

			Siddhant Mehrotra and Yonna Kim

			, the Projects Committee curates interesting and educational adventures that allow you to apply your knowledge 
			beyond solving the clichéd differential equation involving coupled oscillators (though not to diminish the fun in such a problem).  
			From building radios out of fruits and vegetables (hypothetically) to approximating the value of e<sup>π</sup> with 
			only your good judgment and a sprinkle of luck, you bet we will keep you on your toes.

			For the Fall 2020 semester, the first meeting of the Projects Committee will on September 11th, at 6:00PM PDT. A form will be provided with the Zoom link soon!

		<h2 class="content-header"> Destress with SPS</h2>
		<p class="content">
			Sometimes you just need to take an <b>actual</b> break from physics, and we totally get it. 
			That's why starting last school year, SPS has been hosting biweekly Destress with SPS events. These will continue during 
			remote instruction in the form of Zoom friendly browser games, drawing, and more! Come chill with your physics peers and forget 
			about that problem set for a while. Specific dates and times will be announced during the school year.
