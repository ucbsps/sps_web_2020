			Tired of your endless physics problem sets? No better way to take a break from them than doing more (and “funner”) physics with us! 
			Run by the wonderful officers 

			<a href="/officers#projects"> 
			Siddhant Mehrotra and Yonna Kim
			</a>

			, the Projects Committee curates interesting and educational adventures that allow you to apply your knowledge 
			beyond solving the clichéd differential equation involving coupled oscillators (though not to diminish the fun in such a problem).  
			From building radios out of fruits and vegetables (hypothetically) to approximating the value of e<sup>π</sup> with 
			only your good judgment and a sprinkle of luck, you bet we will keep you on your toes.

		<p class="content">
			Need help with homework? Want to hear about other undergraduates' research? Or maybe you just want to listen to 
			Shaunak Modak's voice. Whatever the reason, SPS has an official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSjno74lwImbT04wBJlK3yA" target="_blank">Youtube</a> 
			account! Come check it out!

		<h2 class="content-header"> Destress with SPS</h2>
		<p class="content">
			Sometimes you just need to take an <b>actual</b> break from physics, and we totally get it. 
			That's why starting last school year, SPS has been hosting biweekly Destress with SPS events. These will continue during 
			remote instruction in the form of Zoom friendly browser games, drawing, and more! Come chill with your physics peers and forget 
			about that problem set for a while. Specific dates and times will be announced during the school year.
