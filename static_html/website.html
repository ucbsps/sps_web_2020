			Run by <a href="/officers#webmaster">Carter Turnbaugh</a> , the Website Development  Committee helps develop and maintain the website that you are currently using. Overall, the committee works towards creating a website that allows members to navigate the many available opportunities here at SPS in an efficient manner. If you are interested in helping maintain this website, please fill out <a href="https://forms.gle/SjrBuwqN8pqZVTwY7">this form</a>.

			In the interest of providing more opportunities for assistance with website code debugging, the Website Development Committee has a set of "office hours" on <a href="/gather">Gather</a> instead of regular meetings. For the Fall 2020 semester, these will be from 8:30PM-10:00PM PDT on Mondays and Tuesdays and 2:00PM-3:00PM PDT on Wednesdays. If none of these times work for you, email Carter and we can try to find another time.
