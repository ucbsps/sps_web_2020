				The American Physicists' Tournament (USPT) is an opportunity to explore intriguing physical phenomena with like-minded people outside of the classroom. Pick from <a href="https://iptnet.info/2020/09/11/the-problems-for-ipt-2021-are-now-out/">a list of physical phenomena</a>, delve into the theory, plan experiments, and analyze data in your own unique ways! During the competition, present your team's solutions, oppose other teams' analyses, and engage in scientific discourse to improve methodology. The winning team will be eligible to participate in the 2021 International Physicists' Tournament (IPT).

			The 2020 USPT will be held virtually December 5-6, 2020. Virtual logistics will be announced soon. The deadline for <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeY3wcUMGKiEhOOMMtdvcO2YZ7V578Femf2M-_JBUxLqW8OBw/viewform?usp=sf_link">team registration</a> is November 14, 2020. Interested teams should explore problems long before then!

    		The International Physicists' Tournament (IPT) is a world-class event held in Europe for undergraduate and first- or second-year graduate students from institutions around the world. Participating teams will solve a set of challenging, stimulating physics problems, theoretically as well as experimentally, and prepare to present and defend their findings to opponents and judges. Each country sends one team to compete, and before that, multiple competitions are held in a country at the state or national level to determine qualification. Traditionally, the United States has lacked representation in IPT until the 2018-2019 school year when Berkeley SPS hosted the first national IPT qualifiers which included several Berkeley teams.

    		Last year, with the lead of the Projects Coordinators Siddhant Mehrotra and Yonna Kim, Berkeley SPS invited multiple SPS chapters fromacross the United States. Students from the chapter at Rice University, UC Merced, and UC Berkeley came together during a two-day event where they battled several intriguing physics-based problems. In each round, each team volunteered one person to be either the Presenter, Opposer, and Reviewer. The Presenter explained their solution to a problem, the Opposers presented inconsistencies in the original solution or provided a different explanation, and the Reviewer mediated the discussion. Judges consisting of a panel of graduate students and professors awarded points and provided feedback. In the end, the team representing the chapter from Rice University received the opportunity to represent the United States. The Berkeley SPS team came in a close second, and consisted of juniors Erika Hathaway, Siddhant Mehrotra, sophomores Miguel Ceja and Shantanu Kadam (captain), and freshmen Brandon Abrego and Siddhant Mal. Students who would not have otherwise met were able to share valuable experiences and learn different thinking styles of physical phenomena, forming lifelong friendships and respect.
