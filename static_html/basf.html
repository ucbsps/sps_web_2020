		<h1 class="content-header">SPS will be at the 2020 Bay Area Science Festival!</h1>

		<p class="content">
			The Bay Area Science Festival, traditionally held in Oracle Park, has moved online this year! Berkeley SPS will be contributing to three events:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A virtual lab tour, consisting of a live narration of 360&#176; photos, mimicking the experience of being in person!</li>
			<li>A panel where anyone can ask a scientist questions both about being a physicist and physics itself!</li>
			<li>An interactive demo designed for 4th-5th graders teaching the fundamentals of circuits and how electricity moves.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="content-header">Past Bay Area Science Festival Participation</h2>

		<p class="content">
			With the help of Science@Cal, SPS headed to AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco to demonstrate various physics concepts to kids of all ages for the annual Bay Area Science Festival. Due to our involvement in previous years, we were given a special location in the festival known as the “Teen Scene” (where we engaged teens and non-teens alike). This event is always a lot of fun and tends to be the largest outreach event of the semester!
