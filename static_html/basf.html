		<p class="content">
			Take a real-time lab tour with the UC Berkeley Pyle Research Group, to see a state-of-the-art low temperature detector and learn how this group is optimizing the design of massive low temperature calorimeters for the SuperCDMS low mass experiment as well as for other nuclear physics applications (primarily neutrinoless double beta decay).
		</p>

		<p class="content">
			Lead scientist, Prof. Matt Pyle, will do some cool demos and guide you through the lab, making it feel like you're really there!
