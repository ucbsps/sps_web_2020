		Providing an excellent opportunity for the physics community, student, staff and faculty alike to
socialize and network, Berkeley SPS hosts triweekly open-air barbecues. These barbecues not only
foster community within the department, but also draw in passers-by, enticed by the cheerful
atmosphere and delicious scents.
