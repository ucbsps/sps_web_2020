		Faculty-Student Lunches (FSLs), also known as Student-Faculty Lunches (SFLs), are regular SPS-organized lunches during which a faculty member is invited to share their experiences over a hearty (and free) lunch. They are great opportunities to get to know physics faculty in a casual setting! Learn about ground-breaking research, tips to sail smoothly through college, insider information on classes, or just fun facts about the department over delicious pizza. RSVP to pre-submit questions for Professors, and to get a reminder email right before the event!
