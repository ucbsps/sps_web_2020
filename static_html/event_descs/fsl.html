		Faculty-Student Lunches (FSLs), also known as Student-Faculty Lunches (SFLs), are regular SPS-organized lunches during which a faculty member is invited to share their experiences over a hearty (and free) lunch. They are great opportunities to get to know physics faculty in a casual setting! Learn about ground-breaking research, tips to sail smoothly through college, insider information on classes, or just fun facts about the department over delicious pizza. We ask of you only your enthusiasm and an RSVP.
