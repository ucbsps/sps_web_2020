		Undergraduate seminars are (approximately) weekly events during which an undergraduate gives a publicly accessible talk about their research, project, or just generally anything that they happen to be interested in. These seminars can only happen if we have willing volunteers to share their interests with the rest of the department. Any undergraduate student is eligible to give an undergraduate seminar, regardless of year.
