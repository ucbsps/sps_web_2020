		SPS runs a mentorship program in order to introduce new students (both 1st/2nd year students and transfers) to the undergraduate physics community. Students who have been in the physics program longer are grouped with newer students in order to help guide them through research, classes, and maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
