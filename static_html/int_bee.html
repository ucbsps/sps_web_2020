		<h2 class="content-header">What is Integration Bee?</h2>
		<p class="content">
			Integration Bee is a Math tournament collaboration between <b>SPS</b>, <b>MUSA</b>, and <b>SES</b> where undergraduate and graduate students compete alike to find out who the true master integrator is.
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			Berkeley Integration Bee is the one stop shop for all your mathematical cravings where in the prelims you are faced with 20 super ingenious integrals to solve in 25 minutes.
		</p>

		<h3 class="content-header">How does it work?</h3>
		<p class="content">
			There is a preliminary round (On <b>February 6th</b> through Gradescope for this semester, sign up at the link on top) through which the <b>top 16</b> scorers are selected to participate in the final tournament. The next <b>4</b> top scorers are also kept as a <b>buffer</b> in case any of the top 16 are unable to attend.
		</p>
		<p class="content">
			The <b>final tournament</b>, held a week after the prelims, is a bracket style pairwise face off between the final 16 where both people zoom screen share their work space and race to the given integral.
		</p>
