		<h3 class="content-header">How does it work?</h3>
		<p class="content">
			There is a preliminary round through which the <b>top 16</b> scorers are selected to participate in the final tournament. The next <b>4</b> top scorers are also kept as a <b>buffer</b> in case any of the top 16 are unable to attend.
