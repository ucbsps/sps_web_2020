		<p class="content-large">
			UC Berkeley provides a wealth of resources to support victims of sexual violence. One can seek help through the <a href="https://sa.berkeley.edu/dean/confidential-care-advocate">PATH to Care center</a>, which provides <a href="http://sexualviolence.berkeley.edu/2/resources">these services</a>.
		</p>

		<p class="content-large">
			It is always the victims' decision to pursue any resources or to report an incident. If one chooses to report an incident, there are several ways: 
		</p>
		<ul class="content">
			<li>If there is an immediate threat, dial 911.</li>
			<li>For non-emergencies, call UCPD at (510)642-6760 or Berkeley PD at (510)981-5900</li>
			<li>Visit a medical center. Tell a medical professional that you wish to report a crime.</li>
		</ul>
