		<p class="content-large">
			SPS is the official voice of the physics student body, and a link between the physics department and the undergraduate community. It's also really fun!

		<h1 class="content-header">Who we are</h1>

		<p class="content-large">
			In all seriousness, the Society of Physics Students is a student run organization that serves to provide a community for physics majors and physics enthusiasts (i.e. being a physics major is not required!) and connects the undergraduate population of the physics department to the department as a whole! As a result, we hold events such as faculty-student lunches, undergraduate seminars, department-wide barbeques, and even provide a platform for student-led projects. Moreover, SPS is also involved outreach so as to spread the gospel of physics and science as a whole to the next generation!
