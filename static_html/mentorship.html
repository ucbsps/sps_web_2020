			SPS runs a mentorship program in order to introduce new students (both 1st/2nd year students and transfers) to the undergraduate physics community.
			Students who have been in the physics program longer are grouped with newer students in order to help guide them through research, classes, and maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle.
		</p>

		<p class="content-large">
			Mentorship sign ups are released through our mailing list and are open for the first few weeks of the semester, fall or spring. If you have any questions, feel free to send an email.
