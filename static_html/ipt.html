  		<p>
    			The <b>International Physicistsâ€™ Tournament</b> (IPT) is a world-class event held in <b>Europe</b>
    			for undergraduate and first- or second-year graduate students from institutions around the world.
    			Participating teams will solve a set of <b>challenging, stimulating physics problems, theoretically</b>
    			as well as <b>experimentally</b>, and prepare to present and defend their findings to opponents and
    			judges. Each country sends one team to compete, and before that, multiple competitions are held in a
    			country at the state or national level to determine qualification. Traditionally, the United States
    			has lacked representation in IPT until the 2018-2019 school year when Berkeley SPS hosted the
    			<b>first national IPT qualifiers</b> which included several Berkeley teams.

    			Last year, with the lead of the Projects Coordinators Siddhant Mehrotra and Yonna Kim, Berkeley SPS
    			invited multiple SPS chapters fromacross the United States. Students from the chapter at <b>Rice
    			University, UC Merced,</b> and <b>UC Berkeley</b> came together during a two-day event where they
    			battled several intriguing physics-based problems. In each round, each team volunteered one person
    			to be either the <b>Presenter, Opposer,</b> and <b>Reviewer</b>. The <b>Presenter</b> explained their
    			solution to a problem, the <b>Opposers</b> presented inconsistencies in the original solution or provided
    			a different explanation, and the <b>Reviewer</b> mediated the discussion. Judges consisting of a panel of
    			graduate students and professors awarded points and provided feedback. In the end, the team representing
   			the chapter from <b>Rice University</b> received the opportunity to represent the United States. The Berkeley
    			SPS team came in a close <b>second</b>, and consisted of juniors <b>Erika Hathaway, Siddhant Mehrotra</b>,
    			sophomores <b>Miguel Ceja and Shantanu Kadam (captain)</b>, and freshmen <b>Brandon Abrego</b> and <b>Siddhant
    			Mal</b>. Students who would not have otherwise met were able to share valuable experiences and learn different
	    		thinking styles of physical phenomena, forming lifelong friendships and respect.
