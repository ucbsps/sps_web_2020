		<h2 class="content-subheader">About SPS</h2>

		<p class="content"><b>Why should I join SPS?</b></p>

		<p class="content">Unlocking the secrets of the universe is fun, but it’s even more fun with friends. Also, we have snacks.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>How can I join SPS?</b></p>

		<p class="content">If you want to be a part of SPS, then you already are. Aside from our mailing list (which you can contact us to join) and officer rolls, we do not keep a formal roster of people who are a part of this club. Some students opt to join SPS National, which requires membership dues of $24 per year but provides various benefits such as membership in the American Physical Society and another physics organization of one’s choosing, though most members are not a part of SPS National and it is certainly not prerequisite to being a part of the club in any way.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>How can I become an officer of SPS?</b></p>

		<p class="content">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

		<p class="content"><b>How can I get involved in SPS?</b>

		<p class="content">Outside of weekly meetings, our chapter of SPS facilitates a variety of activities including regular barbecues, faculty-student lunches, outreach events, occasional professional development sessions and panels, and laboratory tours. We are always looking for proactive members to volunteer for these kinds of events. Doing so is a great way to get involved with us and meet a bunch of awesome people who love the same stuff that you do.</p>
