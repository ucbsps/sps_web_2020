		<h2 class="content-subheader">About SPS</h2>

		<p class="content"><b>Why should I join SPS?</b></p>

		<p class="content">Unlocking the secrets of the universe is fun, but it’s even more fun with friends. Also, we have snacks.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>How can I join SPS?</b></p>

		<p class="content">If you want to be a part of SPS, then you already are. Aside from our mailing list (which you can contact us to join) and officer rolls, we do not keep a formal roster of people who are a part of this club. Some students opt to join SPS National, which requires membership dues of $24 per year but provides various benefits such as membership in the American Physical Society and another physics organization of one’s choosing, though most members are not a part of SPS National and it is certainly not prerequisite to being a part of the club in any way.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>How can I become an officer of SPS?</b></p>

		<p class="content">¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

		<p class="content"><b>How can I get involved in SPS?</b>

		<p class="content">Outside of weekly meetings, our chapter of SPS facilitates a variety of activities including regular barbecues, faculty-student lunches, outreach events, occasional professional development sessions and panels, and laboratory tours. We are always looking for proactive members to volunteer for these kinds of events. Doing so is a great way to get involved with us and meet a bunch of awesome people who love the same stuff that you do.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>What happens at SPS meetings?</b></p>

		<p class="content">
			At SPS meetings, we make important announcements often followed by some other kind of professional/fun activity. In the past, we have

			<ul>
				<li>Paired underclassmen with upperclassmen in a mentorship arrangement</li>
				<li>Provided course advice on a variety of classes</li>
				<li>Given research presentations</li>
				<li>Given presentations about giving research presentations</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p class="content">In addition, among other things, we have

			<ul>
				<li>Played board games</li>
				<li>Had a spooky scavenger hunt</li>
				<li>Made Valentine’s Day cards for our amazing physics advisors</li>
				<li>Exchanged gifts in the annual “Secret Schrödinger” tradition</li>
				<li>Climbed to the sixth floor of Campbell Hall (unimpressive)</li>
				<li>Climbed up to the Big C (more impressive)</li>
				<li>Gathered in a lecture hall to watch Spongebob (most impressive)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="content">If that isn’t enough incentive to attend, we even provide snacks! This alone should be incentive!</p>

		<p class="content"><b>Do I have to be a physics major to be a part of SPS?</b></p>

		<p class="content">No. We will love you anyway <3</p>

		<h2 class="content-subheader">Classes</h2>

		<p class="content"><b>What’s the difference between the 5 series and the 7 series? If I already classes in one of these, can I switch to the other mid-sequence?</b>

		There are several notable differences between the 5 series and the 7 series, listed below:

			<ul>
				<li>Whereas the 7 series problem sets are infamously conducted using Mastering Physics, 5 series problem sets are more tailored to hone skills useful in upper division physics.</li>
				<li>In general, 7 series classes tend to be populated by students of many different disciplines including engineering fields whereas the 5 series classes are almost completely populated by physics majors.</li>
				<li>Despite covering similar topics, the curricula of the two sequences differ in important ways. Special relativity is taught in 5A and 7C. Thermodynamics is covered in 7B and 5C, and, in the latter of the two classes, emphasis is placed on statistical mechanics rather than classical thermodynamics. Optics is a subject handled by 5B and 7C.</li>
				<li>While the 7 series includes a built-in laboratory section where each course is 4 units, 5 series classes are 3 units but are paired with the (separate) 2 unit laboratory classes Physics 5BL and Physics 5CL (Introduction to Experimental Physics I/II). 7 series labs usually involve filling out worksheets but include more self-contained lab reports towards the end of the sequence. 5 series labs start off being somewhat worksheet-based in the beginning of 5BL and evolve to complete lab reports by the end of 5BL and 5CL.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p class="content">It is entirely possible (and precedented) to switch between the two sequences if desired. However, because of curriculum mismatches, students are sometimes required to take 1 supplementary unit covering the material that they would miss in the new sequence (under the coursename Physics 49). For example, students switching from 7A to 5B were required to take Physics 49 to satisfy the lower division relativity requirement.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>What are Physics H7A/B/C and how can I take them?</b></p>

		<p class="content">The Physics H7 series was the honors introductory physics series primarily geared towards physics majors. It has since been phased out and replaced by the Physics 5 series, which serves a similar purpose but features a rearranged curriculum and more extensive parallel laboratory courses.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>What is the 8 series?</b></p>

		<p class="content">The 8 series (Physics 8A/B) is the lower division introductory physics sequence for certain non-physics fields such as MCB (molecular and cellular biology) and architecture, among others.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>Do I have to take Math 54? Can I take Math 54 in place of Physics 89?</b></p>

		<p class="content">Math 54 is not a physics requirement in most circumstances. While it never hurts to ask, the physics department has historically been very unlikely to allow Math 54 in place of Physics 89 unless the petitioning student is a double major in mathematics—the math department does not allow Physics 89 in place of Math 54, and the physics department will allow Math 54 if the student is double-majoring in math. This confusion has caused many students to have to take Physics 89 after already having taken Math 54. However, some students report that Math 54 in its own right is a good introduction to/review of linear algebra, which is also covered in Physics 89.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>What is Physics 89 and how is it different from Math 54?</b></p>

		<p class="content">Physics 89, like Math 54, handles the topics of introductory linear algebra and differential equations. However, unlike Math 54, Physics 89 focuses less on rigorous proofs and more on applications in physics—the eigenvalue problem is often almost immediately related to coupled spring systems, for example. Physics 89 also often covers such topics as basic tensor manipulations, Fourier and Laplace transforms, complex analysis, and Green’s functions, although the exact curriculum is semester- and professor-dependent.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>Is there any specific order to take classes in?</b></p>

		<p class="content">There are a few guidelines for what order to take physics classes in:

		<ul>
			<li>Lower division classes should be taken before upper division classes. Some students take upper division physics classes concurrently with their later lower division classes, although this is not necessary.</li>
			<li>Lagging letters in course numbers indicate an order in which classes should be taken (i.e., you should take “Physics 137A” before “Physics 137B”), although some exceptions exist.</li>
			<li>You should generally take prerequisites/co-requisites for a class before/concurrently with that class (although the listed prerequisites are not always necessary; check with your peers who have taken the class before).</li>
		</ul>

		Aside from these, there is a lot of freedom to sculpt exactly how you go about completing the physics major requirements. In your upper division coursework, you will have the ability to take classes in almost whatever order you want.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>Does the 5 series count in place of the 7 series for &lt;insert major here&gt;?</b></p>

		<p class="content">The 5 series is just essentially the honors version of the 7 series, and there is no reason why any department would not allow this substitute. Among others, the astrophysics and EECS majors have accepted the 5 series without question.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>What are Physics 111A/B and when should I take them?</b></p>

		<p class="content">Physics 111A (BSC, basic semiconductor circuits) is a famous (infamous?) circuit laboratory class which is required for all physics majors. Students explore various mostly practical aspects of circuitry, generally with a lab partner. It is famously a very time-consuming course, requiring many hours during the normal semester and even more during the summer sessions, where the pace of the class is greatly accelerated. It is our most sincere recommendation not to take this class alongside too many other technical classes: though it is not “difficult” in the traditional sense, it is extremely demanding on time. Many students also swear by taking the class during the summer; even though the pace is very fast, students are often unburdened from other academic responsibilities and can focus on succeeding both in 111A and in the regular school year. Physics 111B is quite different from 111A in that, rather than exploring basic aspects of circuit design, students perform historical, often Nobel-winning experiments. Students who have taken the course report that Physics 111B is very demanding for a few select weeks out of the semester when a lab is due, but is otherwise different in nature from 111A. While there is no single good answer for when to take this class, many students opt to take it their senior year since it is not really prerequisite for anything else. This class does not need to be taken immediately after 111A.</p>

		<p class="content"><b>Should I take a graduate classes as an undergraduate?</b></p>

		<p class="content">You should really only consider taking a graduate class if you have exhausted the undergraduate classes in a topic and are genuinely interested in moving forward. Bad reasons to take grad classes as an undergrad include:

			<ul>
				<li>My friends are doing it</li>
				<li>I want to look smart</li>
				<li>I want to impress grad schools (on the list of things they care about, this is at rock bottom)</li>
				<li>I want to fulfill a corresponding upper division major requirement (the physics department doesn’t accept these)</li>
			</ul>
