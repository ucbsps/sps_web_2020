<p>
    The <b>International Physicists’ Tournament</b> (IPT) is a world-class
    event held in <b>Europe</b> for undergraduate and first- or second-year
    graduate students from institutions around the world. Participating teams
    will solve a set of <b>challenging, stimulating physics problems, theoretically</b> as well
    as <b>experimentally</b>, and prepare to present and defend their findings to opponents and judges.
    Each country sends one team to compete, and before that, multiple competitions are held in a country at the state or
    national level to determine qualification. Traditionally, the United
    States has lacked representation in IPT until the 2018-2019 school year
    when Berkeley SPS hosted the <b>first national IPT qualifiers</b> which included
    several Berkeley teams.

    Last year, with the lead of the Projects
    Coordinators Siddhant Mehrotra and Yonna Kim, Berkeley SPS invited
    multiple SPS chapters fromacross the United States. Students from the
    chapter at <b>Rice University, UC Merced,</b> and <b>UC Berkeley</b> came together
    during a two-day event where they battled several intriguing
    physics-based problems. In each round, each team volunteered one person
    to be either the <b>Presenter, Opposer,</b> and <b>Reviewer</b>. The <b>Presenter</b>
    explained their solution to a problem, the <b>Opposers</b> presented
    inconsistencies in the original solution or provided a different
    explanation, and the <b>Reviewer</b> mediated the discussion. Judges consisting
    of a panel of graduate students and professors awarded points and
    provided feedback. In the end, the team representing the chapter from <b>Rice
    University</b> received the opportunity to represent the United States.
    The Berkeley SPS team came in a close <b>second</b>, and consisted of juniors
    <b>Erika Hathaway, Siddhant Mehrotra</b>, sophomores <b>Miguel Ceja and Shantanu
    Kadam (captain)</b>, and freshmen <b>Brandon Abrego</b> and <b>Siddhant Mal</b>. Students
    who wouldnot have otherwise met were able to share valuable experiences
    and learn different thinking styles of physical phenomena, forming
    lifelong friendships and respect. Efforts such as this closely follow the
    mission of the national SPS chapter.
